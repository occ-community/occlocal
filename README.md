# OCC Local
Local Development for Oracle Commerce Cloud

OCC Local is an extension for Google Chrome.

When configuring to work with your Oracle Commerce Cloud platform, the extension reads the files in your local folder with the files downloaded by the Design Code Utility (DCU) and replaces the .template, .less, and .js files of your site preview with your local files.

The .template and .less files are updated with a watcher. That is, just save the file it exchanges. There is no need to reload the page.
